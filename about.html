        <p class="paragraph_history">
          Rock, paper and scissors, also called in some regions of Brazil
          jokenpô[1][2] (from the Japanese じゃんけんぽん, jankenpon), is a
          recreational and simple hand game for two or more people, which
          requires no equipment or skill .
        </p>

        <p>
          The game is often used as a selection method (as in choosing teams for
          sports, for example), as well as throwing coins, throwing dice, among
          others. However, unlike these methods that rely solely on luck,
          rock-paper-scissors can be played with a little skill. Especially if
          the game lasts for several turns with the same player, he or she can
          recognize and explore the logic of the opponent's behavior (perceive
          and anticipate the opponent's moves).
